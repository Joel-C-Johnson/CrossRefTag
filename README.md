# CrossRefTag

To create `Cross-references` and `Chain Reference Bibles` by using the Biblical Terms information from [ParaTExt](www.paratext.org). If a translation team worked on the Biblical Terms of the project, this tool will attempt to automatically add `cross-refences` or `chain references as footnotes` for Biblical Term entries by using the information available on the Biblical Terms in a ParaTExt project.

This tool can be incorporated in to ParaTExt as a check (cms) or as a command line tool.

## Pre-requisites

- ParaTExt 7/8 project (or files from a ParaTExt project)
- Biblical Terms must be marked

## How does it work

ParaTExt Biblical Terms information is stored in two files.

1. BiblicalTerms[i]ProjectCode[/i].xml
    - This file has the Biblical Terms and it's renderings in the vernacular project.
1. ProjectBiblicalTerms.xml
    - This file is static across all project (but the content may vary depending on the Biblical Term selected for the project). It has the Biblical Terms and the list of places it occur (this information is stored in a cryptic manner)

CrossRefTag will combine these files to determine the Biblical Terms entries for the project and then try to use that info to update the USFM files with the cross references. 

- Find the Biblical Terms, their veracular renderings and places where each word occurs (by combining the above mentioned files)
- Open USFM files in the project, one verse at a time.
- Look for any Biblical Term in the verse
- If `cross reference` is selected,
  - Add other references of the Biblical term as a cross reference
- If `chain reference` is selected
  - check the marking option user selected (all occurances, first occurance in the book, first occurance in the chapter, first occurance in the verse) and accordingly
  - Add the previous entry and the next entry as a footnote 

## Usage

```shell
CrossRefTag -i [input project code] -o [ouput project code] -p [Path to ParaTExt Projects, default is c:\\My ParaTExt Projects] -c [for Cross-References] -r [for Chain References] -m [[a]ll, [b]ook, [c]hapter, [v]erse]
```
